# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Both apps (`apps/web` + `apps/desktop`) consistently carry the new AlgoPlan identity — every existing user-facing view is implemented in the new design system
**Current focus:** Phase --phase — 01

## Current Position

Phase: --phase (01) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of --name
Status: Executing Phase --phase
Last activity: 2026-04-24 -- Phase --phase execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7-phase structure derived from strict dependency order (tokens → primitives → showroom → shell → kanban → remaining views → rebrand)
- Phase 5: Two-commit split recommended within Kanban phase (API migration first, then restyle) to isolate dnd-kit bugs from visual regressions
- Phase 7: `multica://` → `algoplan://` scheme change is app-facing; must update atomically in both locations. `multica_*` localStorage keys intentionally unchanged (would cause silent data loss)
- Research: Phase 5 requires phase-specific `@dnd-kit/react` v0.4.0 migration research before implementation starts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 pre-implementation: Verify `@dnd-kit/react` v0.4.0 cross-column `group` pattern and optimistic mutation edge cases before writing any code
- Phase 7 pre-ship: Confirm whether production users have Electron app installed — if yes, add `multica://` scheme change to release communications

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Open question | dnd-kit: unified diff vs separate commits in Phase 5 | Recommendation: two commits (API migrate, then restyle) | Roadmap creation |
| Open question | Kanban column virtualization decision gate | Decision: run perf test with 50+ mock cards in Phase 5; go/no-go within phase | Roadmap creation |
| Open question | Password strength meter library (`@zxcvbn-ts/core`) | Decision needed before Phase 6; add catalog entry at Phase 5→6 transition | Roadmap creation |
| Open question | `Source_Serif_4` removal | Audit for remaining uses before removing in Phase 1 | Roadmap creation |
