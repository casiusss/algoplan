# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Both apps (`apps/web` + `apps/desktop`) consistently carry the new AlgoPlan identity — every existing user-facing view is implemented in the new design system
**Current focus:** Phase --phase — 02

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: 00 (complete) → 01 next
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-04-25

Progress: [███████░░░] 74%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 16
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 6 | - | - |
| 02 | 6 | - | - |
| 03 | 4 | - | - |
| 04 P00 | 1 | 2m | 2m |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7-phase structure derived from strict dependency order (tokens → primitives → showroom → shell → kanban → remaining views → rebrand)
- Phase 5: Two-commit split recommended within Kanban phase (API migration first, then restyle) to isolate dnd-kit bugs from visual regressions
- Phase 7: `multica://` → `algoplan://` scheme change is app-facing; must update atomically in both locations. `multica_*` localStorage keys intentionally unchanged (would cause silent data loss)
- Research: Phase 5 requires phase-specific `@dnd-kit/react` v0.4.0 migration research before implementation starts
- Phase 4 Plan 00: IssuePriority enum verified as descriptive ('urgent' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'none'); priority mapping urgent->P0, high->P1, medium->P2, low->P3, none->excluded baked into Plan 05 test scaffolds

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 pre-implementation: Verify `@dnd-kit/react` v0.4.0 cross-column `group` pattern and optimistic mutation edge cases before writing any code
- Phase 7 pre-ship: Confirm whether production users have Electron app installed — if yes, add `multica://` scheme change to release communications

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Open question | dnd-kit: unified diff vs separate commits in Phase 5 | Recommendation: two commits (API migrate, then restyle) | Roadmap creation |
| Open question | Kanban column virtualization decision gate | Decision: run perf test with 50+ mock cards in Phase 5; go/no-go within phase | Roadmap creation |
| Open question | Password strength meter library (`@zxcvbn-ts/core`) | Decision needed before Phase 6; add catalog entry at Phase 5→6 transition | Roadmap creation |
| Partial closure | `Source_Serif_4` removal | PARTIAL: italic axis removed from desktop (Phase 1 Plan 02 Task 2.2). Base import + `--font-serif` token KEPT — onboarding (`packages/views/onboarding/**`) consumes `font-serif` (14 lines / 7 files). Full removal deferred to onboarding-redesign phase. | Roadmap creation; partial closure 2026-04-25 (Phase 1 planner Q4 deviation from D-12) |
